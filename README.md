# Accessibility App
Accessibility is an app that works with the keyboard, so you don't need the mouse to navigate the pages.
The site's colours also respect the necessary contrast for reading. The app has an example of accessible audio, video, form and image. 
<br><br>It was built with node js express to form the routes. 
To start the server with port 3000, just type <br>
      ```
      node app.js
      ```
